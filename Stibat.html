							<p class="Inleiding">For a school I set up a campaign for Stibat together with a project group. Stibat facilitates all players involved in the life cycle of batteries and accumulators. Every year, Stibat runs a week-long campaign that takes in as many batteries as possible. We were given the assignment to create a campaign for Stibat this year. The campaign is called #ABatteryWorld.
							</br></br>
							We have created an application that gives people different assignments (challenges). By doing these assignments, the user helps to improve the world. These assignments have an indirect or direct relationship with batteries. For example, the user must carry out an assignment in which he or she has to wash the dirty dishes by hand instead of the dishwasher, in order to save energy, which in turn contributes to a better world. The user can also challenge his or her friends to do this.
							</br></br>
							The faster the user completes the challenge, the more points the user gets. This also allows the user to win prizes and move up the rankings, which is designed to motivate people to actually complete the challenges. This makes the user feel proud that he or she has made a good contribution to the environment. This makes the user aware of the problems in the environment and therefore the user will pay more attention to the environment.</p>

						<h3>Issue</h3>
						<p>The target audience that will be targeted during this campaign is aware of current environmental problems. However, the target group is not concerned with these problems. One problem that is focused on during this campaign is the return of empty batteries. The target group currently returns little to no batteries. It is necessary to provide this target group with awareness in the campaign so that they understand the importance of handing in their batteries.</p>	
					</li>
					
					<li class="flex-item4 Description">
						<h3>Target Audience</h3>
						<p>A target group of 18 to 30 years old who regularly use wireless electronics was chosen for the concept. This target group makes a lot of use of batteries and a large amount of these do not return their batteries or in the wrong way. However, the concept will change this.</p>		
					</li>
					
					<li class="flex-item4 Description">
						<h3>Objective</h3>
						<p>An objective has been formulated based on the problem definition. This objective serves as a guideline within the project so that it is clear to everyone who is working towards it.
						The objective formulated on the basis of the problem statement is as follows:
						“Encouragement to use the application to raise awareness of everyday environmental issues with the aim of #ABatteryWorld. In doing so, the principles of Stibat are taken into account.</p>
