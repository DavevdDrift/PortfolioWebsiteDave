							<p class="Inleiding">For a groupsproject I developed a learning tool app for the company N-Ice.Coffee. The company teaches people who find it hard to learn things. They train these people to become baristas. During the learning process they are called baristagairs. 
							</br></br>
							These people find it hard to learning and practice assignments. That is why we were asked if we could make something helpfull. 
							</br></br>
							Through research, design and testing, an application has been developed that serves as a learning tool.
							During the exhibition we received a standing applause from our client.
							</br></br>
							For this project I delivered several works with my project group, which is divided into a research report and a design report. </p>

						<h3>Issue</h3>
						<p>The current curriculum is good, however, the program is not supplemented enough outside the teaching hours. This ensures that they won’t learn as good. It also ensures hat they aren’t stimulated enough to learn. As a result, they don’t develop confidence fast enough and they have less pleasure in learning.</p>	
					</li>
					
					<li class="flex-item4 Description">
						<h3>Objective</h3>
						<p>The goal is to design a learning tool that complements the current curriculum into a full program. This will safeguard knowledge and stimulate students more, which will help students develop confidence and make learning enjoyable.</p>		
					</li>
					
					<li class="flex-item4 Description">
						<h3>Target Audience </h3>
						<p>The target group consists of young people with a distance to the labor market. These are young people who have just left (special) education, but for whom an MBO education is not an option. Despite that they want to learn who profession specifically. There are also people who come to N-ice.coffee through benefits agencies or through foundations, who also lack an education.</p>	
					</li>
					
					<li class="flex-item5 Description">
						<h3>Research Question</h3>
						<p>How do you design a learning tool that fully complements the current curriculum, where knowledge is safeguarded and students will be stimulated, so that students develop confidence and start loving to learning?</p>		
					</li>
					
					<li class="flex-item5 Description">
						<h3>Conclusion</h3>
						<p>The curriculum must guarantee knowledge in the shape of practice video’s and practice, which can be achieved through courses, among other things, which allow people to practice their knowledge.
						</br></br>
						Secondly, students must be and remain stimulated, this can be achieved by using gamification. Using a scoreboard, students can achieve their own score and battle for the highest one against each other.
						</br></br>
						Thirdly, self-confidence must be increased. That can be possible by rewarding the student and showing their progress.
						</br></br>
						Finally, baristagairs should also enjoy it. This can be achieved by using things such as gamification and Qoutes.</p>
