							<p class="Inleiding">In the course "Human Computer Interaction" I got to know a new side of my education.
							</br></br>
							I got in touch with new kinds of special elektronics, programms and equipment. A lot of cool and unique programms and machines can be made with these things. As a result, I have learned many new, interesting skills, which have given me a new perspective on the possibilities of my future work.
							</br></br>
							Normally, the study consists of making online visualisations, such as designing and coding applications and websites. However, I have worked with many other subjects during the Human Computer Interaction course. These topics are Wearables, Playfull Interactions, Artificial Creatures and Augmented / Virtual Reality. I also learned a lot of theory about these subjects, which gave me a lot of knowledge about them. </p>

						<h3>Lab Weeks</h3>
						<p>In the last two weeks of the HCI course, 130 CMD students moved together to a premise at Maakhaven, near the Hague University of Applied Sciences. The building consists of a large hall, where everyone carried out various projects. Together with my project group I worked on creating a virtual game.
						</br></br>
						I always wanted to work with Virtual Reality and this was the perfect opportunity. Besides that, I really enjoyed trying Unreal Engine. This is because some of my favorite games are made with that engine.
						</br></br>
						Throughout the lab weeks I was able to put together an amazing short game, together with my project group. In the video game, people had to overcome their fears such as claustrophobia and fear of heights. This caused some fear for many people, but also a lot of fun.</p>	
					</li>
					
					<li class="flex-item4 Description">
						<h3>The Product</h3>
						<p>The final product we made was a Virtual Reality game called “Bad Trip”.
 						</br></br>
						The story is about having hallucinations while partying. As soon as you walk to a certain spot in the disco one of the "Bad Trips" will start to work. This puts you in one of the scary hallucinations of the game. This can be a skyline where you have to walk over falling planks. It can also be a room where the walls are slowly coming at you.
						</br></br>
						The object of this game is to overcome phobias by playing the game. Virtual Reality provides a realistic immersion, which helps creating a realistic but same simulation.
						</br></br>						
						The idea was to make people do something they would never dare doing in real life. That’s how this game tries to help people overcome their fears, in order to improve their lives.</p>		
					</li>
					
					<li class="flex-item4 Description">
						<h3>Website</h3>
						<p>For the course I have made a separate portfolio in dutch language. All of my works and assignments on this website are coming from the course Human Computer Interaction. 
						</br></br>
						There is a lot of extra information and images available on this website. If you would like to see more of this project be sure to check it out!  Would you like to see more reactions to my final VR game? Feel free to take a look at my Portfolio website for HCI!</p>
