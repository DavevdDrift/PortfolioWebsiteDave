						<div class="Selfie">
							<p class="Inleiding">During the first half of the third school year I had an internship at the ANWB. Here I started working as a UX-Designer and UX-Researcher.
							During the internship I did a lot of research and made designs, mainly for the Onderweg app. This is a mobile application that offers functions regarding traffic, parking and refueling. Together with the team that works on the app I made improvements on the current design and I designed a new function for the app called Ontrip.
							</br></br>
							During my internship I worked with UX researchers and UX designers, but I was also in a team with scrum masters, product owners, frontend developers, backend developers and marketers. In addition to Dutch language, English was also used, because some colleagues came from other countries. Together we worked on the Onderweg app. I worked every day from 9 am to 5 pm. Because of this I have built up knowledge and experience what it is like to function as an employee that works on amazing apps.

					<li class="flex-item4 Description">
						<h3>Issue</h3>
						<p>The average age of ANWB app users is around 55 years of age or higher. The ANWB has a need to be relevant for a younger target group, around the age of 35.</p>	
					</li>
					
					<li class="flex-item4 Description">
						<h3>Objective</h3>
						<p>An objective has been formulated based on the problem definition. This objective serves as a guideline within the project so that it is clear to everyone who is working towards it. 
						</br></br>
						The objective formulated on the basis of the problem statement is as follows:
						“Making a proposal on how the ANWB Onderweg app can become more attractive for a younger target audience. This will be done by research, design and testing.”</p>		
					</li>
					
					<li class="flex-item4 Description">
						<h3>Research Question</h3>
						<p>A research question has been formulated based on the problem definition and the objective. 
						</br></br>
						The research question formulated on the basis of the problem definition and objective goes as follows:
						“How can the ANWB apps become more attractive for a younger target group?”
						</br></br>
						The younger target group consists of both men and women aged 25 to 40 with a driver’s license.</p>	
					</li>
					
					<li class="flex-item5 Description">
						<h3>Conclusion</h3>
						<p>Young people will use the app more when route navigation and route guidance is available. The ANWB and the young people would like to have a function in the app called Ontrip. With the Ontrip function, you can use the current functions in the app while driving, in combination with route navigation and guidance. For example, while driving, the user can see if there are traffic jams, parking lots and petrol stations nearby. Meanwhile, the user can also find the fastest route to his or her location by means of route navigation and guidance. It is therefore a combination of navigation apps and functions of The Onderweg app.</p>		
					</li>
					
					<li class="flex-item5 Description">
						<h3>Feedback</h3>
						<p>Based on the research I designed the Ontrip function. At the end I showed the result and everyone loved it. They defenitely wanted to use my designs and ideas in their final product of The Onderweg app.</p>
